You're handed an existing webpage with a button that says "Load Images".

When a user clicks on the button, it populates a div with many, many cat pictures.

The only trouble is that there's a huge delay between clicking the button, and
seeing the pictures. What's worse is that the entire website freezes until the
pictures appear.

How would you approach speeding up the code?
